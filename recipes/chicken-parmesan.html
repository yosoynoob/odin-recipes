        <p><h2>Description</h2></p>
        <p>A crispier take on chicken parmesan while using less sauce.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul><li>4 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves</li>
            <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
            <li>2 large eggs</li>
            <li>1 cup panko bread crumbs, or more as needed</li>
            <li>3/4 cup grated parmesan cheese, divided</li>
            <li>2 tsbp all-purpose flour, or more if needed</li>
            <li>1/2 cup olive oil for frying, or as needed</li>
            <li>1/2 cup prepared tomato sauce</li>
            <li>1/4 cup fresh mozzarella, cut into small cubes</li>
            <li>1/4 cup chopped fresh basil</li>
            <li>1/2 cup grated provolone cheese</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons olive oil</li></ul>
        
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol><li>Preheat an oven to 450&deg;F.</Fieldset></li>
            <li>Place chicken breasts between two sheets of heavy plastic (resealable freezer bags work well) on a solid, level surface. Firmly pound the chicken with the smooth side of a meat mallet to a thickenss of 1/2 inch.</li>
            <li>Season chicken thoroughly with salt and pepper. Using a sifter or strainer, sprinkle flour over chicken breasts, evenly coating both sides.</li>
            <li>Beat eggs in a shallow bowl and set aside.</li> 
            <li>Mix bread crumbs and 1/2 cup parmesan cheese in a separate bowl, set aside.</li>
            <li>Dip a flour-coated chicken breast in beaten eggs. Transfer breast to the bread crumb mixture, pressing crumbs into both sides. Repeat for each breast. Let chicken rest for 10-15 minutes.</li>
            <li>Heat 1/2 inch olive oil in a large skillet on medium-high heat until it begins to simmer. Cook chicken in the hot oil until golden, about 2 minutes per side. The chicken will finish cooking in the oven.</li>
            <li> Transfer chicken to a baking dish. Top each breast with 2 tbsp of tomato sauce. Layer each chicken breast with equal amounts of mozzarella cheese, fresh basil, and provolone cheese. Sprinkle remaining parmesan over top and drizzle each with 1/2 tsp olive oil.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is browned and bubbly and chicken breasts are no longer pink in the center (15-20 minutes). An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165&deg;F.</li>
            <li>The dish is now ready to serve!</li>
